        <p>My hobby is reading interesting and knowlegeable books in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my homework.I am 10 years old and read in class 6th standard.

It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and inatruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in life.</p>
